# YOUTUBE API

_Expose an API endpoint, that when hit will store youtube video titles and **publishedAt** dates for the **GlobalCyclingNetwork** and **globalmtb** YouTube channels to a database. We only want to store videos that match the filter criteria_

This API is built with Node/Express + Amazon's RDS (running MySQL) for the database.

## Getting Started

After installing the dependencies `npm install` in _root_, you can run the application from the console using:

```
npm start
```

The **Backend API** will be available on:
[localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/ "http://localhost:3000/")
